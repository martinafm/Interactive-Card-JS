## General Information
- Idea for project is based on [Frontend Mentror's challenge](#https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/news-homepage-H6SWTa1MFl). My challenge was to build out this interactive card details form and get it looking as close to the design as possible, but also working well.

- Users are able to:
-- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
-- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  --- Any input field is empty
  --- The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
-- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
-- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## Technologies Used
Project is coded with HTML5 and CSS3, using SASS and BEM technology, JavaScript.

## Features
Project:
- Update the details on the card as the user fills in the fields
- Validate the form fields when the form is submitted
- If there are no errors, display the completed state
- Reset the form when the user clicks "Continue" on the completed state
- Is created following the Mobile First principle and is also fully responsible at different breakpoints.
